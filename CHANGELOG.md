## [Unreleased]
*Note: unreleased changes are added here.*
<!-- Change types:
  ### Added, ### Changed, ### Fixed, ### Removed, ### Deprecated
-->
### Added
* Use regular sleep storage if `opts.latest` is false

## 3.3.0 - 2017-05-10
### Added
* Importing - Ignore directories option, true by default

## 3.0.0 - 2017-04-28
### Fixed
* Upgrade hyperdrive with breaking change.

## 2.0.0 - 2017-04-13
Big new release! Hyperdrive version 8 upgrades to our SLEEP file format. The hyperdrive release improves import, transfer speed, and metadata access. It includes a new API much like the node fs API. Lots of cool things!

We've tried to keep the dat-node API changes to a minimum. But we've moved away from using leveldb to storing the metadata, using a flat file format instead. This means the 2.0 release will be incompatible with exiting dat archives.

If you have any old archives, we definitely recommend you upgrade. Any upgrade time will be made up for with more speed!

The major API differences are listed below, we probably forgot some minor changes as several of the underlying modules have changes options or APIs.

### Changed
* Using `mirror-folder` for importing files - this comes with a new event emitter for importing and different options.
* Storage is a lot different! You can specify a directory or a storage function, e.g. `Dat(ram, cb)` now instead of the database.

### Removed
* `opts.db` option - no more database! You can specify a variety of storage formats as the first argument instead.
* `dat.owner` - this is now `dat.writable`.
* `stats` events - we are still in the process of upgrading hyperdrive-stats. Hypercore will also support more stats internally now and we will be transitioning to those soon.
* Import options - `mirror-folder` has fewer options on import.

## 1.4.1 - 2017-03-17
### Fixed
* Pass network `opts` through to discovery-swarm.

## 1.4.0 - 2017-03-08
### Added
* `.datignore` support for ignoring files
* Callback on `joinNetwork` after first round of discovery
* Initial `pause` and `resume` API aliased to `join` and `leave`
* `stats.peers` API with new peer counts

### Fixed
* Better leave network, also closes swarm.
* Clone options passed to initArchive
* Set `opts.file` for archive owner without length
* `createIfMissing` passed to level options
* `dat.close()` twice sync errors
* Fix import without options
* (hyperdrive fix) sparse content archives
